# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project ships on a rolling basis from the `main` branch — there are no
maintained release branches. Security fixes land on `main` and are
documented in the commit history; there is no separate LTS or backport
policy at this stage.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not open a public GitHub issue** for a suspected security
vulnerability. Instead, use GitHub's private reporting flow:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/sarveshtalele/tokentelemetry/security) of this repository.
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"** to open a private advisory.

This keeps the report private between you and the maintainer until a fix
is ready, and gives GitHub's advisory database a structured record once it
is disclosed.

If the private-reporting button isn't available (it depends on a setting
the repository owner controls), open a regular issue that says only "I
have a security report" with no details, and details can be exchanged
through a private channel from there.

## What's in scope

This is a **local-first** tool: the backend binds to `127.0.0.1` only, the
data it collects never leaves the machine it runs on, and there is no
hosted service to attack. In-scope reports include:

- A way for a local exploit to escalate into reading files outside the
  intended install/data directories (e.g. a path-traversal bug).
- A way for the bundled dashboard (a browser page) to make the backend do
  something a same-origin request shouldn't be able to do (e.g. a CSRF or
  CORS misconfiguration issue).
- Command or SQL injection anywhere user-controlled or transcript-derived
  data reaches a shell command or a SQL query.
- A dependency with a known, exploitable CVE that this project actually
  uses in a vulnerable way.

## What's explicitly out of scope

- "The backend has no authentication" — this is intentional for a
  local-first, single-user tool bound to `127.0.0.1`; it is not designed
  to be exposed on a network, and doing so is a deployment choice outside
  this project's threat model (see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)
  for the full reasoning).
- Vulnerabilities that require the attacker to already have local code
  execution as the same user running the tool (at that point they can
  already read the SQLite database directly).
