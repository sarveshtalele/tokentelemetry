# User Guide

A page-by-page walkthrough of the dashboard: what each view shows, what
the numbers mean, and how to get data out of the tool. For how the system
is built, see [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md); for installation, see the
main [README](../README.md#quick-start-install-locally).

## Exact vs. estimated data

Every number in the dashboard carries one of two labels, and the
distinction matters:

- **Exact** — read straight from the Claude API's own usage reporting for
  that request (input/output/cache tokens, cost). Shown with a green badge.
- **Estimated** — a heuristic. The Claude API reports token usage per
  *request*, not per file or tool call, so anywhere you see a per-file or
  per-tool token breakdown, that number was computed by dividing a
  request's exact token count across the tool calls active near it in the
  transcript, then splitting again across the file paths those tools
  touched. A slice that can't be matched to any nearby tool call is
  bucketed as `[unattributed]` rather than silently dropped or guessed.
  Shown with an amber badge.

Treat estimated numbers as directionally useful for finding hotspots
(which files or tools are driving spend), not as a precise per-file cost.
The in-app **About** page (`/about`) has the same explanation, reachable
from anywhere in the dashboard.

## Dashboard

Route: `/`. The global command center — the first thing you see. Shows,
across every project by default (not capped to 30 days — see the date
range filter in the top bar):

- Total tokens, total requests, active projects, and active sessions as
  headline metric cards, each with an info icon explaining exactly what
  it counts.
- A token trend chart (tokens per day).
- A category breakdown (input / output / cache read / cache write) as a
  pie chart.
- A live indicator (top right) that turns green when the WebSocket
  connection to `/ws/live` is receiving updates — meaning the backend
  and daemon are both running and reachable.

## Projects

Routes: `/projects` (inventory), `/projects/:id` (workspace). Every
project Claude Code has been used in is its own telemetry scope, detected
automatically from the working directory recorded in each session
transcript — no manual configuration.

The project workspace page adds a summary card showing that project's
**top skill, top MCP server, and top hook** by call count — useful for
answering "what is this project actually using Claude Code for" at a
glance, without cross-referencing the Tools/Skills/MCP pages by hand.

## Requests

Routes: `/requests` (list), `/requests/:id` (full view). The trace
explorer — one row per Claude API request, with exact token counts,
model, client, and a truncated prompt/response preview. Filter by
project, model, or client, or search.

Click a row to open its full detail; from there, **Open full prompt &
response** opens `/requests/:id` in its own page with the complete,
untruncated prompt and response text (`prompt_full`/`response_full` in the
database) — useful for pasting into another tool or reviewing exactly
what was sent, without the preview's truncation.

## Tools, Skills, Sessions, Clients

Four dedicated breakdown views, each following the same shape (a
distribution chart plus a sortable table):

- **`/tools`** — which Claude Code tools (`Bash`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Grep`,
  MCP tool calls, ...) are driving call volume and context growth, with
  call counts, unique sessions, and first/last-seen timestamps.
- **`/skills`** — skill activations, including which plugin a skill came
  from when its identifier is namespaced (`plugin:skill`).
- **`/sessions`** — one row per Claude Code session (a single `session_id`
  across its lifetime), with token totals and duration.
- **`/clients`** — which client surface requests came from (terminal
  Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains, Windsurf), auto-classified from
  transcript metadata.

## MCP & Plugins

Route: `/mcp-plugins`. MCP tool calls are grouped by **server** — a tool
name like `mcp__github__search_issues` is reported as server `github`,
not as one bucket per distinct tool — so you can see at a glance which
MCP servers (and, separately, which installed plugins) a project actually
exercises. This reads from the `tool_calls` table (backfilled by
reconcile from transcripts), not just live hook events, so historical
usage from before the hooks were installed still shows up.

## Export Reports

Route: `/reports`. Generates a downloadable export of the underlying
data — for spreadsheets, BI tools, or ad hoc analysis outside the
dashboard.

**Report type:**
- **Requests** — one row per Claude request: timestamp, project, session,
  client, model, exact token counts, cost, and prompt/response previews.
- **Projects** — one row per project: total tokens, request count,
  session count, and that project's most-used tool.

**Filters:** narrow by project (or "All projects") and by date range
(all time, or the last 7/30/90/365 days) — the same filter component used
on the Dashboard. A live preview shows the matching row count and the
first five rows before you download anything, so you can confirm the
filter is right.

**Format:** **Download CSV** or **Download JSON** — both stream directly
from the backend (`GET /api/v1/reports/export`) with the filter applied,
named `tokentelemetry-<type>-<timestamp>.<format>`. Exports are capped at
5,000 rows per request; narrow the project or date range if you need more
than that in one file — the preview panel says so if you've hit the cap.

Nothing here calls out to any external service — the export is generated
from the local SQLite database and streamed straight to your browser's
download.

## Settings

Route: `/settings`. Operational view of the collector itself: database
path and size, poll interval, when reconcile last ran, and row counts per
table. The **Reconcile now** button triggers an immediate transcript scan
instead of waiting for the next poll — useful right after a long Claude
Code session if you don't want to wait up to `CLAUDE_TELEMETRY_INTERVAL`
seconds for it to show up.

## About

Route: `/about`. The in-product explanation of what this tool tracks, the
exact-vs-estimated distinction above, and what's intentionally excluded
(no cost/pricing columns in the primary UI, since billing depends on the
plan in effect and isn't a reliable token-telemetry primitive).

## Dark / light mode

Toggle in the top bar (sun/moon icon). Defaults to your OS preference
(`prefers-color-scheme`) on first visit, then remembers your choice in
`localStorage` — every page, chart, and table repaints to match, not just
the base background.
