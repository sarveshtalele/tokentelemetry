        <p>
          Claude Telemetry Enterprise is a small program that runs on your own computer,
          alongside Claude Code. It quietly keeps a record of how Claude Code is being used —
          how many tokens each request costs, which tools and skills get called, which MCP
          servers are active, and which project each of those happened in — and shows it back
          to you in a dashboard you can search, filter, and export.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Nothing about that record is guessed after the fact from a bill or an invoice: it is
          built the moment things actually happen, by reading the same files Claude Code
          already writes for itself. Nothing about it is sent anywhere either — there is no
          account to sign into and no server to trust besides the one already running on your
          machine.

      <Section title="How it works, without the jargon">
        <ol className="space-y-3 list-none">
          <Step n={1} title="Claude Code tells us when something happens">
            Five small hooks (already wired in automatically during install) notify this tool
            the instant a session starts, a prompt is sent, or a tool runs — so live activity
            shows up right away, not on a delay.
          </Step>
          <Step n={2} title="A background process fills in the exact numbers">
            Every request's real token usage only exists in Claude Code's own session files, so
            a background process reads those files on a short timer and fills in the precise
            counts — catching up automatically on anything it missed if it was off for a while.
          </Step>
          <Step n={3} title="The dashboard shows you both">
            Everything lands in one local database, and this dashboard reads from it — nothing
            you see here required Claude Code to be told about this tool, or required any data
            to leave your machine.
          </Step>
        </ol>

      <Section title="Exact vs. estimated — what “attributed” means">
        <p className="mb-3">
          The Claude API reports token usage per <em>request</em>, not per file or tool call. So anywhere
          you see an <Badge tone="success">Exact</Badge> badge, that number came straight from the API.
          Anywhere you see an <Badge tone="warning">Estimated</Badge> badge — attribution hotspots, top
          files/paths, per-project token breakdowns by category — that number is a heuristic: each
          request's exact token count is divided across the tool calls active near it in the transcript,
          then split again across the file paths each of those tools touched.
        </p>
        <p>
          A slice that couldn't be matched to any nearby tool call is bucketed as{' '}
          <span className="font-mono">[unattributed]</span> rather than silently dropped or guessed. Treat
          estimated numbers as directionally useful for finding hotspots, not as a precise per-file cost.

      <Section title="Full prompts and responses">
        <p>
          List views (Requests, Project → Requests) show short truncated previews for speed. Click a row,
          then “Open full prompt &amp; response” to open the complete, untruncated prompt and response for
          that request in its own page —{' '}

      <Section title="What's excluded on purpose">
        <p>
          Cost/pricing columns are intentionally left out of the primary UI — billing depends on the plan in
          effect and isn't a reliable token-telemetry primitive, so it would be misleading to display it
          alongside exact/estimated token data.

          Everything runs on your machine: a Python collector + FastAPI backend on top of a local SQLite
          file, and this React UI talking to it over <span className="font-mono">/api/v1</span> — never a
